## About The Project
üìú This Chrome extension is a UI prototype, meticulously developed using React JS and Tailwind JS. 
1. It operates seamlessly under [Chrome's V3 manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3), demonstrating exceptional integration and performance.

1. As soon, i might integrate public proxies.
2. To provide a seamless user experience, this extension exemplifies the power of modern web development frameworks.

‚úç ‚ú®The prototype developed by me in Figma is [available here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1383629443351683238/proxyease-browser-extension)
